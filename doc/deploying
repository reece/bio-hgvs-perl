Quick how to for deploying and starting a specific version of
bio-hgvs-perl


1) Fetch the repo.
Reece's convention is to install bio-hgvs-perl as the locusadm user in
into /locus/opt/bio-hgvs-perl/<checksum>, where checksum is the hg
checksum for a specific commit.

me$ sudo -u locusadm -i
locuadm$ hg clone -r afe16a659b63 ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/reece/bio-hgvs-perl afe16a659b63

Optionally, make a symlink to this directory:
locuadm$ ln -fns afe16a659b63 tip

locuadm$ cd <checksum> (for subsequent steps)


2) Get prerequisite perl modules that are available from Ubuntu (or other
distribution).

You probably don't need to install anything if this machine is already
running bio-hgvs-perl.  Missing modules are fatal.  Therefore, you can
skip this step to see if there's an actual problem.

To install:
me$ sudo -u make get-dist-modules
(You'll need to revert to your login for the sudo to work)


3) Install prerequisites that aren't in Ubuntu

If you did make get-dist-modules, then a file called make-dist-modules
exists. If not, touch it. Then:

locusadm$ make ext


4) Configure Ensembl variables.
At Locus, do this:
source /locus/opt/ensembl/config


5) Start hgvs-web-service
locusadm$ ./bin/hgvs-web-service >/tmp/bio-hgvs-translator.log 2>&1 &
locusadm$ disown

(disown is a little-known command that disconnects a specified job, or all
jobs if none are specified, from the terminal. Logging out will no longer
send the HUP signal to the program.  It's like a post-facto nohup.)


6) Test it
locusadm$ curl 'http://localhost:7777/hgvs/translate/NP_003218.2:p.Val713Met'



* Troubleshooting

- Bio::HGVS::Error: failed to start daemon
This error almost certainly means that the port is in use.
